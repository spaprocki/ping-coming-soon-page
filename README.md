## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

- [A modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This is a reset stylesheet I am planning to use in my following coding projects.
- [Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally implement CSS Clamp for fluid change of font-size between screen sizes, while mixing rem and vw to express font-size. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
